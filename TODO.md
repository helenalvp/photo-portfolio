This is a photography portfolio that i will be doing from scratch. The plan is to start programming for mobile devices and change it to web once the mobile version is ready. 

Since i do not have much to work with, i will start with creating the Navbar, and then slowly create the template and layout for every page, making sure to allow for easy cuztomization and adjustment based on customer's needs and wants. 

I also need to make sure that i take the care of the person's work into account. that means either adding a watermark with the works or finding a way to make sure that photos arent ripped off of the site and used without the owners permission. 

-create style and layout theme
-create navbar
-create different pages (home, works, service, contact, about)
-create layouts for the different pages (possibly 2 mobile and 2 desktop options)
-see where instagram integration is possible (im thingking either works or about me, and have animation for the work shown)
-ensure safety of customer's works and images
